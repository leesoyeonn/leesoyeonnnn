<p>For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness;</p>
<p>and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.</p>
<p>Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, it's at the end of your arm, as you get older, remember you have another hand:</p> 
<p>The first is to help yourself, the second is to help others.</p>
